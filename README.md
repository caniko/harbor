# harbor-llm

Generic harness integrations, starting with session/project-scoped dev-shell
switching in OpenCode. Language Harbors own compilers and their dev shells;
`harbor-meta` owns generic shell composition. Consumers supply project roots,
approval policy and backend configuration. Model serving and provider catalogs
belong to inference integrations, separate from this environment engine.

## MCP admission library

`harbor-llm/mcp-admission` is a provider-neutral ESM library with TypeScript
declarations. The entrypoint has no runtime imports from OpenCode, Paperclip,
Hermes or an MCP transport SDK. It performs no I/O and retains no credentials,
grants or session state. The existing harness integration remains a separate
entrypoint with its own dependencies.

Consumers install this private source package from an exact Git revision of
`https://github.com/caniko/harbor-llm.git`. Git installation needs no build or
prepare script. Pin the full commit in the dependency declaration; a moving
branch or a local worktree link is not a deployment pin. The MCP library and
its contract assets use the MIT license in `src/mcp-admission.LICENSE`.

```js
import { bindMcpServersToRun, requireMcpRunBinding } from "harbor-llm/mcp-admission";

const [server] = bindMcpServersToRun({
  servers: [{ connectionId: "reader", url: "https://tools.example/mcp" }],
  runId: "run-1",
  executionHostId: "host-a",
  policy: {
    version: 1,
    servers: {
      reader: {
        url: "https://tools.example/mcp",
        gatewayUrl: "https://worker.example/api",
        serverHostId: "host-a",
        executionHostIds: ["host-a"],
      },
    },
  },
});
requireMcpRunBinding(server.runBinding, {
  runId: "run-1", executionHostId: "host-a", gatewayUrl: "https://worker.example/api",
});
```

The operator/controller supplies the trusted policy after its own authorization.
`connectionId`, `runId` and host IDs are opaque consumer identities. `url` is the
exact resolved MCP endpoint; `gatewayUrl` is the exact approved credential
recipient. Both require HTTPS or explicit loopback HTTP, without URL credentials,
query strings or fragments. Display names and caller extensions survive binding;
old binding metadata is replaced by a fresh frozen binding. Cross-host delivery
requires an explicitly allowed execution host and an own `authorizedCrossHost:
true` field at the consumer boundary. Consumers map an omitted execution target
to their trusted local worker identity before calling; a missing identity is
blocked rather than guessed.

Consumer-owned recipient aliases may be supplied through `normalizeRecipient`.
Raw approved and actual URLs are validated before normalization. Either callback
failure yields a content-free `McpAdmissionError` with
`code: "runtime_mcp_admission_blocked"` and a finite `reason`, without a retained
exception cause. Limits cover eight servers per run, 64 execution hosts per
server, 128-character identities, 2048-character endpoints and 64 KiB policies.

Portable assets are exported under `harbor-llm/contracts/`:

- `mcp-admission-policy.v1.schema.json`
- `mcp-run-binding.v1.schema.json`
- `mcp-admission-conformance.v1.json`

These are the same schemas imported by the runtime, not a consumer-maintained
copy. Version 1's identifier pattern requires a regex engine supporting negative
lookahead (JavaScript and Python do; RE2 does not). Validators must reject a final
newline rather than relying on `$` end-of-line semantics. Other languages must implement the semantic checks as well as structural
schema validation. A JSON binding is metadata, never a bearer credential or an
authenticated grant. Tenant/project/agent/task/operation grants, destination
authentication, token expiry/revocation, physical-host attestation, network and
shell isolation, provenance, recovery reauthorization, cancellation and verified
operation settlement remain integration responsibilities. Sharing this metadata
does not establish a reusable lifecycle runtime or prove live worker acceptance.

Run the focused checks with `node --test test/mcp-admission*.test.mjs`. They cover
the portable vectors, inherited authorization attacks, callback redaction, an
independent authenticated loopback MCP service, and packed exports without
installed harness dependencies. Consumers qualify their actual delivery paths
separately.

### Python consumers

The root `pyproject.toml` builds the `harbor-llm` Python distribution. Pin its
full Git revision as for the ESM package. `harbor_llm.mcp_admission` exposes
`bind_mcp_servers_to_run`, `require_mcp_run_binding`,
`parse_mcp_admission_policy`, `require_mcp_credential_endpoint`, and
`is_mcp_admission_identifier`. Bindings use read-only mappings; exceptions carry
the same finite `reason` and content-free `runtime_mcp_admission_blocked` code.
It has no transport, harness, or third-party runtime dependency.

Packaged assets come from the canonical `contracts/` directory. Both languages
run its vectors and a differential test covering malformed host lists, policy
booleans, and URL parsing. Exact endpoints require explicit authorities and
portable host spelling: encoded hostnames and repaired abbreviated/numeric IPv4
forms are rejected. Consumer-owned alias normalization runs only after raw URL
validation. This is a tightened syntax check, not physical-host attestation.

Run Python checks with `python3 -I test/test_mcp_admission.py`; the Node suite
also runs the differential check (`HARBOR_TEST_PYTHON` selects an interpreter).

## Project environment contract

- No agent command is accepted or executed by the environment backend.
- An operator-installed registry names canonical project directories and exact
  dev-shell derivations. No `.envrc` evaluation or automatic approval occurs.
- Selection requests `harbor_dev_shell_prepare` permission for the exact
  `project:shell:/nix/store/...drv` identity, including cache hits. Preparation
  can realize dependencies and executes the trusted shell hook. It is not a
  read-only operation and does not activate NixOS or Home Manager.
- Bash commands are unchanged and still pass through the harness permission
  check before their child environment is resolved.
- Selection is isolated by session and project. Concurrent commands capture
  immutable selections. Conflicting switches fail instead of racing.
- Captured environments live only in process memory, scoped to the session.
  Clearing a selection restores normal harness/direnv behavior; deleting the
  session releases its captures. Preparation failures retain the previous shell.
- Only Linux and OpenCode's patched legacy `ShellTool` are supported. The V2
  core Bash implementation currently has no plugin environment hook and is
  unsupported. No fallback command runner is provided.

This is **not a sandbox**. Approved build scripts, hooks, binaries on PATH,
other plugins, and commands retain user authority. A trusted hook can read
mutable project files or perform side effects. Startup injection variables are
stripped from captured output, but this does not make an untrusted hook safe.
Permissions must not auto-allow `harbor_dev_shell_prepare` for arbitrary sources.
An agent with unrestricted writes to harness configuration could change policy;
that is outside the command prompt policy's security boundary.

## Approval and revisions

The registry is rendered by Home Manager into the Nix store. It has no agent-side
write or approve operation. Runtime approval is handled by OpenCode's ordinary
permission UI. New derivations produce distinct permission identities.

Editing a working tree does not silently update its registered shell. The
operator must evaluate and install a new registry to consume updated dev-shell
declarations/inputs. Code being compiled may remain dirty; the shell definition
remains pinned. There is no implicit "trust all future shell revisions" mode.

## Home Manager

### Project-direnv prototype for v2

`plugins/project-environment-prototype` is an **unconfigured feasibility
prototype**, not a replacement for the production adapter. It selects by
session and canonical flake root, discovers derivation-valued
`devShells.<system>` attributes, and runs the project's approved `.envrc` from
a clean, fixed baseline for each command. Selection does not edit project
files. Approval follows the operator-configured `direnvApproval` mode.

Owned projects can opt into named selection with an `.envrc` convention:

```bash
use flake ".#${PROJECT_DEV_SHELL:-default}"
export PROJECT_DEV_SHELL_ACTIVE="${PROJECT_DEV_SHELL:-default}"
```

Default/clear omits the selector; the project chooses its normal default.
The acknowledgement prevents silently ignoring a requested shell. Existing
`.envrc` exports/hooks remain authoritative. Unapproved files, failed captures,
missing choices and nix-direnv stale fallbacks reject the operation. Commands
capture the environment for their launch directory; a later `cd` does not
change it. Non-flake projects can use approved direnv but have no shell menu.

Coverage decides which environment applies, never whether a command may run.
A launch outside `roots`, or one whose discovered `.envrc` lies beyond the
configured boundary, uses the configured baseline without executing or
approving any `.envrc`, and reports `fallback` instead of failing. Inside the
boundary an ancestor `.envrc` applies to ordinary launches in nested
directories — including nested flakes that carry no `.envrc` of their own —
while the shell catalog comes from the nearest `flake.nix`. Explicit selection
never falls back and never inherits: it fails when the workdir is outside
`roots`, when no in-scope `.envrc` exists, and when the applicable `.envrc`
lives outside the selected flake root (an ancestor `.envrc` cannot acknowledge
another flake's shell name on its behalf). A rejected selection is not
recorded, and a previously selected project whose local `.envrc` is removed
rejects instead of silently redirecting to its ancestor.

The prototype now uses a **proposed upstream shell hook API** with native
`sessionID` and a preparation `AbortSignal`. It sets the invocation's environment
directly: no session-global environment swapping, no shell-tool replacement,
and no serialization of running foreground commands. Preparation alone is
serialized per session so pending manual approvals are not duplicated.
Identical concurrent exports also share one in-flight preparation across
sessions. Each waiter rechecks approval, the definition and watched inputs;
cancelling one waiter preserves the others. Completed environments remain
direnv-owned. For nix-direnv's watched profile body, freshness compares its
contents and retained target: refreshing GC-root timestamps cannot invalidate
an unchanged environment. Separate processes serialize exports sharing a nix-direnv layout
through persistent, private flock anchors. Pin `setsid` and `flock` executable
paths when configuring the Linux adapter.
Old upstream events lacking that context fail closed. Options are `roots`,
absolute `direnv`/`nix` paths, `system`, and a loopback `serverURL`; authentication
uses the managed backend's `OPENCODE_PASSWORD`. Operator slash commands are
`project-env-select` (`{"cwd":"/project","shell":"docs"}`) and
`project-env-clear` (`{"cwd":"/project"}`), and `project-env-retry`
(`{"cwd":"/project"}`) for an explicit retry of a blocked generation. Agent-side selection authorization
is not implemented by this prototype.

For a native `serve --service` backend, set `opencode` to the absolute v2
executable instead of exporting `OPENCODE_PASSWORD`. The plugin obtains the
credential with `opencode service get password` under the same isolated XDG
directories. Native v2 owns the 0600 credential file; neither Nix settings nor
project environments need to contain the password. This mode is not for a
foreground `serve` instance with an unrelated ephemeral password.

An isolated canary can supply `projectXdg` with absolute `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
`XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and/or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` paths for project
preparation. This preserves the normal direnv/nix-direnv configuration and
approval database while the backend keeps its separate OpenCode storage.
Only these four keys are accepted; the backend process environment is unchanged.

Resolve, select and clear share one session preparation queue and approval
flow; a selection is committed only after successful preparation. Cancelling
a queued caller settles it promptly without cancelling its predecessor, and
the cancelled operation never starts later. Session deletion cancels preparation
and releases choices. A session move or plugin reload resets choices to project
defaults; environment snapshots and choices are not persisted. Plugin unload
aborts preparation and closes its lifecycle subscription. Running commands keep
their already-captured snapshots. Selection applies to the native shell hook;
other execution paths require their own supported integration.

`direnvApproval` accepts `"auto"` (the default) or `"manual"`. In auto mode,
preparing an environment automatically runs native `direnv allow` for a new or
changed `.envrc` within configured project roots, then rechecks trust before
exporting it. Explicit `direnv deny` remains blocked in either mode and uses
the manual approval flow. Native direnv trust is user-wide; shell choices are
still session-scoped. Command permissions are not bypassed. The same mode
applies to preparation during select and clear, not catalog listing.

Use `{"direnvApproval":"manual"}` to retain the approval form/retry workflow.
Invalid modes fail configuration validation. In both modes preparation is
**lazy**: changing `.envrc` alone does not
interrupt a session or request approval. Reads/edits remain available and an
already-running command finishes with its captured environment. The next
command that needs an unapproved environment waits on a v2 session form before
spawning. Other preparation in that session waits behind it; existing processes
continue and completed work is not replayed.

`preparationTimeoutMs` bounds direnv export (default 600000 ms / ten minutes,
maximum one hour). Approval/status checks remain bounded at ten seconds and
flake catalog evaluation at two minutes. Safe progress logs identify the phase,
launch directory, effective `.envrc`, trust state and preparation ID; failures
distinguish timeout, cancellation, buffer overflow, exit code and termination
signal without exposing hook output or environment values. Linux preparation
uses `setsid` (optionally an absolute configured `setsid` path) so cancellation
also terminates its helper processes. This does not cancel running commands.

Use the shell tool's `workdir` field for another project. A `cd` inside the
command changes its eventual directory but does not select another environment:
preparation has already occurred at launch. The native shell description includes
this guidance. Approval and successful environment evaluation are separate gates;
auto approval cannot repair a failed Nix evaluation, download or build.

In manual mode (or after explicit denial), the form identifies the canonical `.envrc` and its revision. Review and grant
trust using native `direnv allow`, then choose **Approved in direnv — retry**.
The form does not grant trust itself: every retry checks direnv again. Editing
while a form is pending cancels the obsolete form and resolves the current
revision. Declining rejects the held operation and suppresses repeat prompts
for that session/revision; it never falls back to the old environment. Caller
cancellation removes its pending form. This implements an execution barrier,
not a watcher that pauses reasoning or interrupts active jobs.

**Upstream dependency:** proposal `e11f63b2f743dc37da7621408a5b5486e2a9b2b4`
in [draft upstream PR #50644](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/50644),
based on upstream `b8aa08f260130452dc87fbc20c2a4e2ff743e642`. It exposes validated
session identity and cancellation in both Promise and Effect shell APIs. Native
tests cover direct-user-shell identity and interruption before spawn. It is a
contribution branch, **not an upstream merge or a production dependency**.

The hook signal covers preparation and is aborted on hook completion or caller
interruption; it is not a child-process lifetime signal. The updated native shell
tool authorizes the original command, shell and working directory **before** the
preparation hook. Hook changes to those fields require authorization again before
spawn. A denied original invocation executes no project preparation.

`environment: "project"` is the default shell-tool mode. Use
`environment: "bootstrap"` explicitly for repair. Configure `bootstrapEnvironment`
as an independent string-to-string host-tool environment (requiring `PATH` and
an absolute `HOME`); bootstrap never loads `.envrc` or session-selected environments and never
copies the project baseline. Missing configuration fails explicitly. Bootstrap
retains command permissions and bypasses the session preparation queue so repair
remains available while project preparation is waiting.

Recognized `LOCK_DRIFT` failures block repeated exports for the unchanged input
generation within this plugin instance. Content changes to `.envrc`, `flake.nix`,
or `flake.lock`, native watch changes, or `project-env-retry` release that block.
The block is bounded and resets on plugin reload; successful caching stays with
direnv. Progress receipts include native invocation, session, tool-call and shared
preparation identities without environment values. Catalog queries require the
existing lock with `--no-update-lock-file` alone: Nix's `--no-write-lock-file`
permits an in-memory relock even when both flags are supplied.

`consistencyLocks` maps canonical project roots to absolute persistent anchors.
Exports and catalog queries take shared locks; a cooperating declaration/lock
promotion takes the same anchor exclusively. For example, configure an anchor
at `/workspaces/example/.git/environment-preparation.lock`. The lock covers definition
visibility only; it does not replace evaluation or nix-direnv layout locks.

The old registered-tool wrapper's direct-shell bypass is closed in that modified
candidate: both paths now wait at the same hook, and native command denial still
prevents side effects. This is not evidence that unmodified upstream is ready.
PTYs and formatters still need equivalent context/coverage; this entrypoint is
not yet an all-commands production policy. Verify the native hook capability
against the exact backend selected by the consumer.

Run the model-free native-executor canary against an explicit candidate:

```sh
node test/check-project-environment-v2.mjs /absolute/opencode /absolute/direnv /absolute/nix
```

For source testing, set `OPENCODE_SOURCE=/checkout` and pass the declared Bun
executable instead of `opencode`. The check uses isolated state and fixtures,
tests direct-shell approval plus native permission denial, and preserves its
redacted backend log. `PROJECT_ENV_PLUGIN` may select an exact packaged plugin
directory. It does not open production state or issue provider requests.

The Nix `environments` check supplies real direnv/Nix binaries. Local resolver
tests run with `DIRENV_BIN=/absolute/direnv NIX_BIN=/absolute/nix node --test
test/project-environment.test.mjs`. Fixture flakes are evaluated but not built;
they test catalog selection and `.envrc` behavior, not nix-direnv realization.

The experimental Pkl MCP plugin has been removed. This package owns project
environment preparation, not a separate language-server implementation.

### V1 environment adapter

After publishing and locking this flake, import
`inputs.harbor-llm.homeManagerModules.default`. Minimal V1 consumer:

```nix
{inputs, pkgs, compatibleOpencode, ...}: {
  imports = [inputs.harbor-llm.homeManagerModules.default];
  programs.opencode = {
    enable = true;
    package = compatibleOpencode;
  };
  programs.harborLlm = {
    enable = true;
    opencode.enable = true;
    opencode.apiVersion = "v1";
    projects.example = {
      root = "/workspaces/example";
      shells = {
        default = inputs.example.devShells.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default;
        docs = inputs.example.devShells.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.docs;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

`compatibleOpencode` must implement the neutral version-1 replacement contract:
the `shell.env` input carries `harborLlm: 1`, and `harborLlmReplace: true` in
the output requests full environment replacement. Permission checks precede
preparation and replacement. The package exposes
`harborLlmEnvironmentVersion = 1` in its passthru, preserved by any wrapper.
The module rejects an unmarked V1 package, and the adapter independently
requires the runtime handshake before selection. A package marker alone is
not execution evidence. Runtime patches and architecture-specific process
policies belong to the consumer's integration layer.

V2 is the module's default API. Set `programs.harborLlm.opencode.options`
with explicit `roots`, `serverURL` and managed `opencode` executable (or supply
the native service credential at runtime). The module supplies immutable
direnv/Nix/setsid/flock paths. V1 uses `plugin`; V2 uses `plugins`; only one
entrypoint is rendered. The V2 runtime must expose the session-aware native
shell hook described above.

`preparationLockDirectory` optionally selects an absolute persistent lock
directory. Its default is `harbor-llm` under the private runtime directory,
or the user's cache fallback. Integrations migrating an existing installation
must configure the old directory until all old preparation processes have
drained. Keep the same anchor inodes throughout that transition.

Restart OpenCode once after installing the module. Run an ordinary Bash call to
verify the replacement hook (a direnv rejection can still establish the hook
handshake). Then use `harbor_devshell` with `list`, `select`, `status`, or `clear`.
Changing a selection needs no restart. Direct `nix develop -c`, `direnv exec`,
and other command-wrapper permissions remain unchanged.

Preparation uses a fixed `nix develop <approved-drv> --profile <private-runtime-profile> --command <store-node>
<store-capture>` operation, with a timeout, output bound, and process-group
cancellation. Hook output and captured values are never included in tool
responses. Realized store paths are reused by Nix; captured environments are
not reused across sessions. Private runtime profiles retain toolchain GC roots
for the harness process lifetime; normal exit removes them, while a crash may
leave them until reboot. These profiles contain Nix store references, not
captured credentials. No cache publication or credential refresh is
performed by this adapter. Operators may pre-realize approved shells through
their normal build and cache publication workflow.

Hooks that depend on an interactive TTY, leave background services running, or
export paths into Nix's disposable preparation directory are not supported.
Temporary-directory variables are reset after capture; arbitrary references
to transient files cannot be repaired automatically. Use persistent,
project-independent setup in language Harbor hooks, such as Harbor's Cargo cache.

## Checks

```sh
node --test test/*.test.mjs
treefmt --ci
```

Flake checks expose the stdlib tests, packaged plugin entrypoints, module
evaluation, formatting and the `harbor-meta` dev-shell check. Runtime patch
qualification belongs to the integration that owns the patch. Live OpenCode permission
denial, two-shell switching, and Rust compilation still require deploying the
patched runtime. Unit tests do not establish those live integration guarantees.
