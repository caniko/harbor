# Qualification record

Recorded on 2026-10-05. The implementation remains pre-qualification.
Source availability, package builds, execution, numerical checks, convergence
and physical validation are independent gates.

## Actual OpenLB CPU reference

The real OpenLB 1.9.0 driver was compiled with GCC 15.3.0 against revision
`145cd54810b468f4b6fd3ed86b10644264841578`, with the local VTK precision patch.
The test uses a **procedural STL**, independently of FreeCAD. It is evidence
for this bounded CPU formulation, not for CAD integration or a GPU backend.

| Parameter | Explicit fixture value |
|---|---|
| Geometry | 0.02 × 0.01 × 0.01 m channel; STL vertices in mm |
| Boundaries | Periodic x/z; stationary bounce-back y walls |
| Kinematic viscosity | 1e-5 m²/s |
| Acceleration | 0.001 m/s² |
| Density | 1 kg/m³, synthetic material |
| Precision / collision | Float64 D3Q19 forced BGK, relaxation time 0.8 |
| Duration / retained times | 20 s; 0, 10 and 20 s |
| Numerical gate | Relative velocity L2 error ≤0.05 and improvement under refinement |

| Resolution | Fluid cells | Lattice steps | Lattice Mach | Relative velocity L2 error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 1024 | 1280 | 0.0270632938683 | 0.0111244282661 |
| 16 | 8192 | 5120 | 0.0135316469341 | 0.00278138734196 |

The Python verifier independently decodes zlib-compressed VTK payloads,
checks actual Float64 byte lengths and finite values, follows relative
PVD→VTM→VTI references, and compares the retained velocity to
`u(y)=a*y*(h-y)/(2*nu)`. The driver independently computes the same error
using OpenLB's relative L2 reduction. Material IDs and physical pressure
are retained; pressure has not received an independent numerical benchmark.
Time collections use lattice steps, with explicit requested/observed SI
time mappings in the receipt. Solver convergence remains **not assessed**.

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_openlb_cpu.py \
  --executable /absolute/path/to/harbor-cad-openlb \
  --output /absolute/new/evidence-directory
```

Local authoritative run artifacts:
`/data/scratch/tmp/opencode/harbor-cad-openlb-final/`.
Each resolution directory contains the input plan, procedural STL, process
log, execution/numerical receipt and native VTK files.

Earlier high-drive runs at 0.1 m/s² exceeded the fixed driver's low-Mach
limit. Their velocity agreement is **not qualifying evidence**. The planner
and driver now reject lattice Mach >0.1 before running this formulation;
they preserve the caller's scientific parameters.

### Writer repairs

OpenLB's original `SuperVTMwriter3D<T,T>` labelled arrays Float64 while its
buffer and binary payload remained Float32. The regression verifier failed
on the actual payload length. The recorded patch preserves `OUT_T`, sizes
the zlib buffer with `compressBound`, checks compression failure, rejects
UInt32 payload overflow, and retains coordinate precision.

The original driver also surrounded the periodic box with x/z wall layers,
producing effectively zero through-flow. The driver now uses cell-centred
periodic extents with walls only in y and checks the STL dimensions and
expected fluid-cell count. It rejects other voxel geometries rather than
claiming generic CAD-flow support.

## Actual OpenLB HIP reference

The source at `dca055fd03ef4b4a80d2f104b1aff204ff520510` adds packaged HIP
execution of the same **procedural STL** channel. The [backend decision](gpu-backends.md)
prioritizes HIP/ROCm for AMD OpenLB and defers CUDA to best-effort. OpenLB has no
Vulkan backend at the existing immutable pin; equal-accuracy Vulkan/HIP
performance remains unmeasured.

`openlb-hip`, the updated CPU reference and `runtime-hip` passed guarded Canix
packaging. ROCm runtime 7.2.3 and AMD Clang 22.0.0-rocm came from the existing
locked Nixpkgs. Matching rocThrust/rocPRIM are explicit build dependencies;
compile and link architecture is `gfx1100`, with no native GPU auto-detection.
The dependency-scan patch uses host-only preprocessing because the pinned
compiler otherwise emits binary offload data into Make's `.d` file. Numerical
compilation and linking retain the GPU target. The upstream version banner
still says `1.8r1`; receipts identify the exact pinned 1.9.0 source revision.

The clean runtime identifies **RX 7900 XTX**, PCI `0000:03:00.0`, `gfx1100`,
25,753,026,560 bytes reported total VRAM and an exact HIP UUID. The tested host
kernel was `7.2.8-cachyos-lto`. This is measured compatibility for the fixture,
not support for all Radeon GPUs or an AMD-supported NixOS configuration.

The first GPU run retained fields but correctly **failed** the unchanged 0.05
velocity gate with error `0.9615692648832852`. Inspection of pinned
`gpu/hip/column.hh` established that `setProcessingContext(Simulation)` uploads
host mirrors. Calling it every lattice step reset GPU populations to the last
observation. The adapter now keeps steps resident and changes context at output
boundaries. The same model, resolution, duration, precision and tolerances then
passed:

| Resolution | CPU analytical velocity relative L2 | HIP analytical velocity relative L2 | Maximum retained CPU/HIP velocity relative L2 difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 0.01112442826614978 | 0.011124428266122175 | 3.124827453983309e-14 |
| 16 | 0.0027813873419648702 | 0.0027813873418746048 | 1.0485508411701897e-13 |

Every 0/10/20-s retained PVD→VTM→VTI step was decoded independently. Float64
payloads, topology, coordinates and components were checked; material IDs
matched exactly and full retained velocity agreement passed `1e-10` relative
L2. Finite Float64 pressure differences were recorded diagnostically; pressure
accuracy and convergence remain unqualified. A changed retained velocity was
also rejected by the comparison verifier.

Each HIP receipt verifies exact PCI/UUID, compiled/runtime architecture, one
local HIP block, kernel completion and no CPU block fallback. Six negative
cases rejected before solver output: duplicate OpenLB stages, stale UUID,
wrong backend, missing card, `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` spoofing and executing a
GPU-required plan with the CPU package.

The trusted numerical fixture runs through `examples/openlb_hip_probe.rs`,
using the production physical-card reservation and native-process helpers.
`scripts/verify_openlb_hip.py` verifies cgroup v2 service limits before starting:
at most 2 GiB RAM, zero swap, two CPUs and 128 tasks. The final service recorded
those exact kernel controls, a 354,652,160-byte RAM peak, 4.729-second reported
runtime and a 900-second deadline. These include both CPU/HIP runs and rejection
checks; they are not comparative solver-performance or VRAM-peak measurements.
Systemd's successful transient service was unloaded after exit, so subsequent
default `systemctl show` values are not used as runtime-control evidence.

Exact commands, source/binary hashes, package roots, failed attempts and the
final report at `hip-qualified/verification.json` are recorded in
[`evidence/gpu-backends.json`](evidence/gpu-backends.json), under
`/data/scratch/tmp/opencode/harbor-cad-amd-20261005/`. The final repackaged HIP
executable is byte-identical to the executable used by that report; only the
dependency patch's whitespace context changed. The runtime JSON includes the
separately packaged CAD, HIP solver, EGL renderer and VAAPI encoder.

The final native-language gate passed **52 Rust tests**, **31 Python cases**,
Clippy with warnings denied, Treefmt and Ruff. Neither this controlled probe nor
`runtime-hip` qualifies production KFD/selected-device isolation, cross-root
capacity/VRAM admission, durable worker GPU execution, CLI/MCP B1, GPU filters or
physical validation. The worker continues to reject unqualified GPU execution.

## HIP sandbox candidate

`backend hip-identity <pci>` now correlates the selected AMD PCI device, its
amdgpu driver, DRM character-device minor, KFD node/GPU ID, nonzero PCI/KFD
unique ID and GFX target. ROCr 7.2.3 formats the unique ID as ASCII hexadecimal;
CLR copies those 16 characters into `hipUUID`. The adapter's hexadecimal byte
encoding is therefore independently reproducible from the observed sysfs ID.
The parser rejects malformed/duplicate attributes, links, topology generation
drift and a second KFD GPU node.

The candidate sandbox mounts the selected render node and `/dev/kfd`, with
read-only topology/CPU/NUMA metadata. The unchanged resolution-8/16 Float64
channel passed with errors `0.011124428266122175` and
`0.0027813873418746048`. Its inventory reported exactly the selected HIP
PCI/UUID. Removing the render node while retaining `/dev/kfd` rejected ROCm
initialization with `no ROCm-capable device is detected`.

[`evidence/hip-sandbox.json`](evidence/hip-sandbox.json) binds the immutable ROCm
sources, exact command, candidate source hashes and report. This is observed
runtime compatibility on the single-KFD-GPU host. Running-kernel source matching,
raw KFD exclusion of another GPU and durable worker HIP remain separate gates;
the production worker still rejects compute sandboxing.

## Real systemd lifecycle

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_systemd.py \
  --executable /absolute/path/to/harbor-cad \
  --output /absolute/new/lifecycle-directory
```

The executed test used the million-point synthetic analytical reference
with an explicit 0.01 tolerance, a 512 MiB profile and a 60 s time limit.
It passed:

- a forced worker SIGKILL followed by worker restart while the independent
  user-service job completed successfully;
- cancellation through the matching persisted service InvocationID;
- effective `MemoryMax=176777216` (the approved plan's peak estimate),
  `TasksMax=128`, `CPUQuotaPerSecUSec=1s`,
  `NoNewPrivileges=yes` and `KillMode=control-group`.

Receipts: `/data/scratch/tmp/opencode/harbor-cad-systemd-frozen-profile/verification.json`.
This establishes the tested single-process reference lifecycle. Native
descendant-tree cancellation, logout/reboot behavior and GPU/importer/JIT
sandbox qualification still require separate execution.

## Worker, transport and artifact checks

- Rust tests cover units/applicability, immutable approvals, durable
  idempotency, restart, traversal/symlink rejection, service-name ownership,
  explicit CPU/B1 planning and physical-role separation.
- Official MCP SDK stdio-client tests exercise the same Rust worker;
  CI rejects native planning and exposes no shell/evaluation tools.
- Export tests reproduced partial final-directory publication and silent
  truncation after 256 artifacts. Exports now stream verified copies into
  private staging, sync them, and publish with no-clobber atomic rename.
  A 302-artifact export retains every registered shard.
- Native output ingestion makes verified copies of closed files, preserves
  nested relative references, and rejects symlinks, special files and
  incomplete outputs. Native arrays remain outside protocol responses.
- Byte-bounded artifact pages traverse 302 long descriptors through the real
  Unix-socket client without response overflow or missing shards. Official
  MCP tests traverse the same cursor API. Whole-bundle export remains complete.
- Admission reserves one plan per state root across worker restarts, counts
  retained artifact bytes, includes native copy staging, and leaves capacity
  waits queued. The CI profile's disk allowance is 8 MiB for multiple retained
  runs; its scientific per-plan allowance remains unchanged.
- Host profiles are atomically bound with submissions and checked by digest.
  A real worker test modifies the source configuration while a job is waiting
  for disk space, then verifies that the admitted job uses and exports its
  original profile. Reusing a key with profile drift is rejected.
- Physical-card reservations now use private per-user anchors across state
  roots rather than separate locks per worker. Tests verify case-normalized
  PCI aliases, shared compute/render/media ownership, contention, release of
  partially acquired sets, and rejection of traversal/symlink anchors. This
  establishes lock behavior, not measured GPU execution or VRAM headroom.
- Approval validation now checks hand-built OpenLB plans against the same
  low-Mach formulation gate as generated plans, requires integral periodic
  extents, rejects SI timestamps collapsing onto one lattice step, and
  requires retention of the final scientific state. Converter arithmetic
  follows the pinned OpenLB constructor and `getLatticeTime` source.
- Adapter process-group tests exercise actual descendants under monitoring
  errors, timeouts, and early leader exits, and verify that unrelated groups
  remain alive. The leader is observed with `waitid(..., WNOWAIT)` and kept
  unreaped until cleanup finishes, preventing recycled-PGID cleanup. Actual
  importer/GPU sandbox and detached-session descendants remain separate gates.
- Failed native attempts snapshot regular outputs and opaque partial files
  with failed-attempt provenance. Unsafe and over-budget entries remain raw
  and are explicitly reported. Tests cover verified copies, unsafe omissions,
  over-budget preservation and terminal-failure export. Raw outputs after forced
  service death are recovered after confirmed service termination.
- Terminal exports include a checksummed `execution.json` with the original
  plan, recorded profile and job state; a failed export is not promoted into
  successful scientific evidence. Quarantined symlinks are counted for disk
  admission without following them or poisoning later jobs.
- Historical plans are archived with their original checked digest and inputs
  even when the current applicability gate rejects relaunch. The exported
  `current_plan_check` reports that rejection; archival does not weaken the
  active submission/launch gate.
- Native runtime paths reject lexical traversal out of `/nix/store` and
  validate their canonical store destination. The SI plan is outside the
  writable native tree and mounted read-only, removing its writable sandbox
  alias. These source-level repairs still require an effective sandbox test.

Local Rust checks used `rustc 1.100.0-nightly (574ff7d98 2026-09-14)` from the
approved Canix environment. The locked CLI package also built with the declared
Rust 1.94.0 toolchain. Python checks used Python 3.13.15 and uv 0.12.5.

Latest local checks passed: 46 Rust integration tests plus six Rust unit tests, Clippy with
`-D warnings`, 31 official-MCP/adapter Python cases, Ruff lint/format checks, and
scoped treefmt. The actual OpenLB CPU and user-manager tests above are
separate opt-in runtime evidence.

Additional native-boundary checks bind imported CAD to a distinct digest-checked
snapshot, reject symlinks/budget overflow without publishing input bytes, and
reject absent or mismatched CPU execution receipts. Receipt descriptors reject
FIFOs, symlinks and oversized records without blocking. Native jobs archive the exact
selected runtime manifest. `scripts/verify_native_cpu.py` prepares the packaged
FreeCAD → CPU OpenLB → portable-bundle qualification through CLI and MCP; its
packaged synthetic-fixture run passed. The CPU runtime does not select
ParaView/media closures.

The CAD-only planner exposes `case plan-cad-inspection` and MCP
`cad_plan_inspection` in the cad/all profiles. It binds an explicit relative
source and lowercase SHA-256, retains the caller's case and uses only the
importer and bundle stages. Hand-built plans receive the same source/digest
checks. CPU protocol tests prove the CI policy rejects native inspection and
that the cad profile cannot submit jobs implicitly.

An actual regression test proved that an environment-only fake `INVOCATION_ID`
could previously execute a service job. Job startup now verifies the live unit's
invocation, main PID and exact cgroup membership before its state transition,
and archives `service-owner.json`. The subsequent real systemd restart and
cancellation test passed against one frozen binary, with the archived owner
matching the user manager. One earlier rerun failed because a concurrent Cargo
build replaced the running development binary; the verifier now copies and
checksums its executable before launching. That failure remains retained and
does not count as passing evidence.

An actual Bubblewrap 0.11.2 probe showed that `/work/plan.json` leaves an empty
mount-point file in the writable output tree. The worker now mounts its trusted
plan at `/plan.json`, outside that tree. A second primitive-level probe passed:
the plan and store were read-only, the host-private marker and user-manager
socket path were hidden, host-loopback TCP was unreachable, GPU nodes were
absent and no mount-point file polluted output. This verifies those tested
primitives, not the full packaged importer/JIT/GPU policy.

The extended real systemd verifier first failed because a forcibly killed
service's raw partial bytes were absent from export. After the fix, worker
restart following owned-service SIGKILL and ordinary cancellation both exported
the exact seeded bytes under `failed-native/` with `native-failure.json` and the
correct failed/cancelled status. The raw fixture is explicitly synthetic opaque
adapter data, not a native solver result. Recovery uses the original
digest-checked plan's output allowance, retains quarantined omissions, and
records recovery errors in the terminal diagnostic. The worker does not attach
to a changed service invocation.

The later packaged native recovery qualifier also passed with actual FreeCAD
and OpenLB at resolution 64. After the initial native channel VTI closed,
owned-service SIGKILL plus worker restart produced a failed job (exit 9), and
ordinary cancellation produced a cancelled job (exit 143). Both bundles have
23 verified records and preserve the exact 61,287-byte initial VTI, including
independently decoded finite Float64 velocity, pressure and material arrays
with shape 130×68×66. The original runtime manifest and live service owner
are retained; no successful OpenLB receipt is present. This qualifies partial
native-field recovery, not solver resume, convergence or a completed solve.

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_native_recovery.py \
  --executable /nix/store/CLI/bin/harbor-cad \
  --runtime /nix/store/RUNTIME-harbor-cad-native-runtime.json \
  --output /absolute/new/native-recovery-directory
```

The verifier freezes its CLI inode, uses a two-GiB RAM/one-GiB disk profile
and one thread, and operates only on its own job units. Exact package,
receipt and field hashes are in [evidence/native-recovery.json](evidence/native-recovery.json).

The hosted CPU workflow is generated from `simit.toml` by Simit revision
`afb7939d925d3e8e9b8507387ada7efad6460df8`. The installed 0.19.0 binary
rejects `[ci].check_command`; an archived clean revision was compiled without
changing the Simit checkout. Generated-file `--check --diff` passes. The
workflow uses commit-pinned actions, a hash-locked uv 0.12.5 bootstrap,
`rust-toolchain.toml`, locked Cargo/uv dependencies and explicit Python
3.13.15. It runs formatters, lints, CPU contract/path/admission/export tests,
and the real official MCP client on public hosted runners with read-only
repository permission. The workflow has not executed remotely because no
push has been performed. Systemd and native/GPU execution remain opt-in local
checks. Native Nix CI must be added after the actual consumer lock/build gates
are available; a passing CPU workflow cannot establish A0 or B1.

`python3 scripts/check_cpu.py` is the shared 20-minute CPU gate. The current
generator retains event-scoped concurrency groups, so push/PR runs are not
coalesced, and it does not expose a total job timeout; these generator gaps
remain recorded upstream requirements. Generation defaults are preserved.

## Current gate status

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| A0 | Partial: locked CPU packages/parity/contracts passed; production importer closure-only isolation, resource controls and descendant cleanup passed for controlled fixtures; other native policies remain separately unqualified |
| A1 | Analytical airflow reference plus real low-Mach OpenLB CPU velocity/refinement check; thermal/wetting/FEM references incomplete |
| B1 | Packaged FreeCAD→CPU OpenLB→bundle passed through CLI/MCP; scoped HIP numerical reference and retained CPU fields→EGL surfaces→VAAPI adapter probes passed; durable HIP solver/worker integration unqualified; CUDA best-effort |
| B2 | Renderer/media RAM/CPU/wall/output measured; no qualified numerical GPU filter, per-process VRAM peak or complete topology/ghost-cell round trip |
| C–F | Not implemented |

### Execution binding, retention and importer qualification

The latest lifecycle/importer slice is documented in
[execution-lifecycle.md](execution-lifecycle.md). New submissions bind the exact
runner, runtime, selected native files and sandbox-policy revision atomically
with the original plan/profile. A real-worker test queues a job under runner A,
restarts with worker B, and verifies execution still uses A; duplicate submission
reuses the original binding. Historical records keep their approval identity and
export a null binding where it was never recorded.

Active systemd jobs now hold indirect GC roots before acknowledgement. Crash
tests cover partial registration, lost acknowledgement, pre-commit orphans,
duplicate reuse, queued cancellation, restart and interruption during cleanup.
Terminal status alone cannot release a systemd runtime while its recorded or
live execution cgroup remains populated. Packaged native recovery passed with
actual roots present across worker death and released after complete-tree closure.
The two resolution-64 recovery bundles now retain 25 verified records, including
the unchanged 61,287-byte initial Float64 VTI with shape 130×68×66. Recovery
remains interrupted solving, not convergence or successful solver resume.

The production importer qualifier also passed through the packaged worker:

- Individual read-only mounts for its 672-object declared runtime closure;
  no broad store mount, GPU nodes or host session runtime.
- Read-only approved source and plan; source bytes remain identical.
- Live synthetic host credential/environment, Unix-session and loopback-TCP
  canaries hidden or unreachable; separate network namespace with only loopback.
- Actual 1 GiB service RAM limit, one-CPU quota, 128-task limit, 60-second
  runtime limit, no-new-privileges and bounded output-file size.
- Detached descendants terminated on both success and missing-`wall` rejection;
  15- and 13-record checksummed bundles respectively.
- Five actual Nix runtime roots per job, released only after tree closure.

The exact source review of nine published FreeCAD advisories and the selected
1.1.4 extraction guards is retained in
[evidence/freecad-security.json](evidence/freecad-security.json). These are
controlled-fixture and tested-abuse-case results; broader solver/GPU/JIT,
logout/reboot and arbitrary-assembly qualification remain independent gates.

The complete retained-field EGL→VAAPI sequence was rerun with the new
[frame binding](frame-sequence.md). It passed at 640×480, matching the exact
rendered manifest to the completed receipt and encoded video. Physical requested
times 0/10/20 s, observed times 0/10.000000000000002/20.000000000000004 s and
24-fps playback timestamps 0/0.041667/0.083333 s are exported independently.
Source fields remained bit-for-bit unchanged. Single-run render/media RAM peaks
were 638,685,184/194,781,184 bytes and elapsed times 1.867/0.565 seconds; these do
not establish peak VRAM or an equal-accuracy performance comparison.

Full evidence is under
`/data/scratch/tmp/opencode/harbor-cad-job-lifecycle-20261005/`.
Compact record/hashes are in [evidence/job-lifecycle.json](evidence/job-lifecycle.json).
The final packaged CLI includes interrupted-cleanup recovery, resource-estimator
validation and the terminal-service admission handoff fix. Its complete
FreeCAD→CPU OpenLB workflow passed again through CLI and official MCP, with 30
verified records at each resolution (8 and 16). CAD inspection retained 14
records through each interface; missing-region and changed-source cases rejected.
The production importer and native forced-death/cancellation qualifiers then
passed against that same final CLI. Exact package and evidence identities are
recorded in the compact evidence file.
The final guarded `checks.x86_64-linux.python` build also passed with explicit
`--include-tests`, one build job and two cores. Its derivation/output and the
CLI/runtime/MCP/render/media package identities are retained in the evidence.

Hand-built resource declarations are now checked against operation-specific
[allocation/output minima](resource-estimates.md), including padded lattice
cells, distributions, native output at every retained time, reader/frame copies
and encoding staging. Authoritative aggregate same-user capacity, effective VRAM
headroom and card-wait scheduling before service launch remain pending.

Read-only inventory exposed AMD devices at `0000:03:00.0` (with a render
node) and `0000:7d:00.0` (without a render alias); no CUDA device was
available. Inventory is not EGL/VAAPI execution evidence. CUDA UUID/minor
correlation and per-device sandbox mounts remain explicit rejection gates.

### Packaged CAD inspection and selected-device media

Five additional Canix gates passed against `96d3942838179fefa664373be7816c6fcfd8c026`:
CLI, MCP, media, Python protocol tests and clean runtime. The packaged inspection
verifier passed real FCStd import through both CLI and MCP, preserving source
bytes and producing 12 checksummed records per CAD-only bundle. Changing the
approved source caused a failed job before importer launch, with no input
snapshot/import receipt and seven checksummed diagnostic records. The full
resolution-8/16 CPU reference also passed again.

The actual `NativeProcess` library with packaged Bubblewrap 0.12.0 stopped a
detached-session child's writer on normal exit, timeout and monitor rejection.
Its scratch harness used dependencies with exact source/checksum parity to
the repository lock. This closes that bounded detached-descendant gate;
worker SIGKILL/systemd cancellation evidence is recorded independently above.

The packaged FFmpeg 9.0.1 adapter encoded three explicitly synthetic 128×128
PNGs with `h264_vaapi` on `0000:03:00.0`, observed as Radeon RX 7900 XTX through
Mesa Gallium 26.2.1/radeonsi. Actual CPU decoding verified three yuv420p frames,
dimensions and presentation timestamps 0, 0.041667 and 0.083333 s at 24 fps.
Observed configuration enables GPL/version3 and disables nonfree. This qualifies
only the selected media adapter probe, not EGL, physical-time labels or B1.

Initial probing exposed a sandbox defect: libdrm 2.4.134's `drmNodeIsDRM`
requires selected-device sysfs metadata even with an open render FD. Its official
archive was verified against locked Nixpkgs' SHA-256. The production Rust binding
now correlates the live character-device major/minor, DRM sysfs entry and exact
PCI device, mounting six PCI metadata attributes and the selected render sysfs
directory read-only. PCI config/resources, other cards and the rest of sysfs
stay hidden. Actual production-library encoding and mount-isolation probes
passed under a bounded systemd service. A separate 64×64 fixture correctly
failed the driver's reported 128×128 hardware minimum; the qualifier now uses
an explicit 128×128 fixture and does not resize user frames.

Exact build outputs, qualification hashes and scoped source evidence are in
[evidence/inspection-media.json](evidence/inspection-media.json).

### EGL display identity and calibration

The production EGL helpers passed an offscreen OpenGL calibration under the
production DRM sandbox and owned native-process library. The current initialized
EGL display's `EGL_DEVICE_EXT` resolved to `/dev/dri/renderD128`, matching selected
PCI `0000:03:00.0`. Observed EGL 1.5/OpenGL 4.6 used the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and
Mesa 26.2.1/radeonsi. Every 64×64 framebuffer readback pixel matched the expected
RGBA calibration value, with zero GL error and no software renderer.

The pinned VTK source shows that `DeviceIndex` represents requested selection
and that default-display fallback exists. The adapter now checks the live
display's actual device before issuing a success receipt. The Khronos extension
defines `EGLAttrib` as `intptr_t`; the bridge uses the matching ctypes width.
Bounded enumeration rejects missing, changed and ambiguous inventory. Five CPU
regression cases cover actual-device rejection and authoritative channel time
collection selection, including rejection of a symlink/material-only collection.
The driver emits both `channel.pvd` and `geometry.pvd`; only the channel collection
uses the velocity/pressure observation clock. Unsupported presentation fields
are rejected explicitly.

The first headless ParaView package failed CMake's relative-install-destination
check. The committed fix uses the pinned Nixpkgs recipe's relative GNUInstallDirs;
later ordinary Canix gates passed against `9511dba` and `dd3ccbc`. The preceding
retry realized ParaView but its final Canix receipt rejected source drift; that
attempt is not counted as a passed guarded gate. The archive hash, runtime
library and initial calibration receipt are in [evidence/egl-device.json](evidence/egl-device.json).

### Retained-field EGL surfaces and VAAPI video

The packaged renderer and media adapter passed with resolution-16 CPU OpenLB
fields from the checksummed native bundle. All native files and science
parameters remained unchanged. The recipe explicitly chooses a presentation
camera `[0.04, 0.025, 0.03]` and fixed velocity scale 0..0.0015 m/s. Actual EGL
context identity matched the selected RX 7900 XTX/renderD128; no software
renderer was accepted. The three 640×480 surface frames correspond to lattice
steps 0/2560/5120 and observed physical times 0/10/20 s.

Pixel inspection of the first successful renderer probe showed only an outline.
A native assertion then proved that ParaView's first render also changed the
requested camera automatically. The adapter now explicitly renders velocity
magnitude surfaces, disables that reset and automatic color-range growth,
and verifies camera/range/representation after every screenshot. The receipt
retains each frame's native step, observed physical time and annotation.

The selected `h264_vaapi` encoder produced three yuv420p frames at 24 fps;
actual CPU decoding verified dimensions, count and presentation timestamps
0/0.041667/0.083333 s. A separate device-free sandbox decoded the video into
PNGs. Every decoded image visibly preserves its 0/10/20 s label, units and
fixed scale; the zero-time surface and later velocity colors are distinct.
The final run's video is byte-identical to the independently inspected video.
The playback clock does not represent the solver's physical-time spacing.

The qualifier uses the production DRM binding, native-process containment and
shared physical-card reservation. Measured whole-service RAM peaks were
189,026,304 bytes for rendering and 74,137,600 bytes for media; elapsed times
were about 1.266 s and 0.414 s, including stage startup and native cleanup.
These are single measurements, not equal-accuracy performance comparisons.
Per-process VRAM accounting and headroom remain unqualified. A negative probe
requesting unretained time 5 s failed before producing any frame or success
receipt, without altering the fields or relaunching a solver.

```sh
cargo build --locked --example native_stage_probe
python3 scripts/verify_egl_fields.py \
  --probe "$PWD/target/debug/examples/native_stage_probe" \
  --runtime /nix/store/RUNTIME-harbor-cad-native-runtime.json \
  --render /nix/store/RENDER/bin/harbor-cad-render \
  --media /nix/store/MEDIA/bin/harbor-cad-video \
  --bundle /absolute/native-cpu-bundle-16 \
  --pci 0000:03:00.0 --output /absolute/new/egl-field-probe
```

The script records receipts and hashes; independent image inspection is required
to qualify label pixels for a new run. Exact package/code/video/decode hashes,
resources and rejection evidence are in [evidence/egl-fields.json](evidence/egl-fields.json).
An additional CPU-only probe used the same packaged ParaView PVD/VTM reader
at every retained step, comparing its actual ImageData arrays with independent
zlib decoding. All velocity, pressure and material Float64 payloads matched
bit-for-bit, with their component counts, point association, complete extents,
SI origin and spacing. This 34×20×18-point fixture has no cell or ghost arrays;
the result does not qualify other topologies or partition/ghost handling.
The rebuilt hardware-independent Nix Python check also passed all seven
protocol/render-contract cases under ordinary Canix admission against `3abc667`.
This closes the bounded selected-device field-render/media adapter probe,
while required GPU OpenLB, worker B1, numerical GPU filters and physical
validation retain their separate gates.

## Canix package evaluation and realization

All eight selected package/check targets passed through ordinary Canix admission
against `bffb87bf2db916fcffc41bc1c838915b5bb2969f`: CLI, MCP, CPU OpenLB, CPU
runtime, clean-runtime, Python protocol tests, effective unfree/Fleetix policy,
and the actual procedural-STL OpenLB numerical reference. Builds used one job,
two cores and `--no-push`; no host activation occurred. The CLI used Rust 1.94.0;
the packaged solver reported GCC 16.2.0. Exact derivations, retained output
paths, logs and hashes are in [evidence/packaged-cpu.json](evidence/packaged-cpu.json).

`scripts/verify_native_cpu.py` then exercised packaged FreeCAD 1.1.4 and OpenLB
inside Bubblewrap 0.12.0 under tracked systemd jobs. Resolution 8 used CLI and
resolution 16 used the official MCP stdio client, both against the same worker.
Every exported record, runtime manifest and service owner was verified; retained
Float64 velocity/pressure/material fields preserved the requested 0/10/20 s
mapping. Each bundle contains 28 checksummed records. The velocity errors match
the independent procedural-STL reference above and improve about fourfold.
This is synthetic fixture/CPU integration evidence; it does not establish
pressure accuracy, convergence, GPU execution or physical validation.

`canix repo eval --wait-seconds 300 --directory
/data/nvme0/can/canix/projects/repos/owned/harbor-cad
'git+file:///data/nvme0/can/canix/projects/repos/owned/harbor-cad#packages.x86_64-linux.default.drvPath'`
passed against commit `2e52eb0699f471ec0f00f1f2a7013dc7444ad1a1`, resolving
`/nix/store/h1g62w3d4fssnjqnh4jr5x9hzm448gc8-harbor-cad-0.1.0.drv`.
This is evaluation evidence only. The read-only evaluation resolved inputs
but did not write `flake.lock` or realize the CLI. The subsequent correctly
routed scoped Canix update succeeded and created `flake.lock`; all 11 root
revision pins were checked against the dependency manifest, and the lock records
their generated NAR hashes.

The first package-build sequence did not enter the evaluation phase: its
300-second ordinary-admission window ended behind PID `4022767`, running
`canix cache binary build .#roborev-aarch64 --no-push --max-jobs 1 --cores 2`.
No Harbor-CAD package was realized by that attempt. The exact failed receipt
is retained alongside the scoped source/runtime evidence.

CLI, MCP, CPU OpenLB, CPU runtime and policy/clean/Python check derivations also
evaluated successfully. Subsequent lock/build attempts encountered the shared
evaluation lease. The installed update/build commands have no evaluation-wait
option, so scoped updates use bounded ordinary-admission retries.

The Home Manager launcher overwrites `CANIX_FLAKE_ROOT` with the parent Canix
checkout; a preceding managed-input rejection came from that routing. Using the
same installed package's `bin/canix` preserves the explicitly selected root and
normal Canix guards. It then reported Harbor-CAD's missing `cachePinMeta`.
The consumer now declares supported schema 4 with no cache-managed inputs; all
its dependencies remain immutable pins. No upstream/host change, raw Nix
override, inherited evaluation lease, concurrent bypass or upload was used.
Lease-release notices allowed another lane's normal workspace admission to
complete before the next Harbor-CAD evaluation.

Commands use the installed package CLI for updates and target-checkout cwd for
builds. From an approved environment in the Harbor-CAD checkout:

```sh
CANIX_PROJECT_CLI=/nix/store/77dc01dssq4ss86xw8d2z5fxa39l3q3r-canix-admin-0.1.0/bin/canix
CANIX_FLAKE_ROOT="$PWD" "$CANIX_PROJECT_CLI" repo update flake --input nixpkgs
canix cache binary build .#default --no-push --max-jobs 1 --cores 2
canix cache binary build .#mcp --no-push --max-jobs 1 --cores 2
canix cache binary build .#openlb-cpu --no-push --max-jobs 1 --cores 2
canix cache binary build .#checks.x86_64-linux.clean-runtime \
  --include-tests --no-push --max-jobs 1 --cores 2
```

The package sets explicitly override Harbor-Py's permissive unfree default.
The optional CUDA set uses an enumerated predicate. Effective Nix policy
checks passed for both effective package sets and Fleetix source/digest parity.
Active-job closure retention, aggregate multi-worker admission, GPU VRAM budgets,
effective importer/JIT sandbox profiles, and engineering physical inputs
remain qualification work.
